I recently learned commands to use on Mac and Linux. Not sure about windows!
#Commands
1) Use $exa -l instead of $ls -l (it will show details in colored format)
exa -l -T to render in tree format.
2) rip grep to grep text from files
$rg hello
$ fill in later to search within PDFs and movie titles ...
3) plocate to locate the file with text in the filename.

#Vi
In vi editor, search with /[search text]; press n to go next and N to go back.
